S 1: I’ve been looking forward to this moment.
C 1: Well, I’m eager to know what’s what with you.
S 2: Well, do you mean in terms of the past year or right now?
C 2: Oh, right now, whatever your concerns are in your present life. I guess that’s what I’m interested in.
S 2: Well, um, I come here with an agenda, like, of a particular thing I’d like to discuss with you. And, and I think that discussing it will be helpful in terms of my, of my life.
C 2: Uh-huh. Then that’s what I’d like you to discuss.
S 3: Well, I think I’m doing very well in many ways, and I need to do some work, too. And, uh, the most pressing thing with me is that I plan to go to work in the fall,full-time, and have the care of both of my sons. Without any support other than what I’m earning. And I, and I, I don’t feel very upset about it, but I believe that deep down in my body I’m really afraid. (Smiles.)
C 3: Are you afraid of the responsibility or, or what aspect of it is most frightening?
S 4: Well what, what seems most frightening as I think about it is coming home from work very tired and having, um, two little boys that need a lot. (C: M- hm.) (Her voice quivers.)
C 4: Will you really be able to be a mother to them when they, when you come home from work. Hmmm?
S 5: Well, I’m sure I can do it because I, it’s done every day. And, uh, the women I know an... who are trying to do that are having a really hard time. (C: M- hm.) (3 seconds pause.) And I’ve been thinking about talking about this problem now with you. I haven’t really... I, I talk about in a heady way with my friends, and, uh, I haven’t given myself any real support (C: M-hm.) with it. It’s a real fear I have, and it’ll probably be really hard. 
C 5: And you haven’t really had a chance to explore it in, in depth; you’ve talked about it more on a, on the surface level.
S 5: Well, the exploring I’ve done is... I decided for myself- well simple, I’ll look for other single working mothers with young children who are doing well. And I’ll talk to them and see what they do. So I started asking, asking my friends, asking some people I know, “Do you know of this kind of person?” Well after about a month, I didn’t come up with one, one single woman taking care of young children and working full-time who was doing very well and that scared me.
C 6: So the track record, the track record that the other people have, the other women have makes you really concerned about will you be able to do it?
S 7: Well that substantiates my concern.
C 8: Yeah. Yeah.
S 9: I’ve had the concern. I wish, I keep wishing I could find some secrets to make it easier for myself. Andthe only secrets I can come up with are working half-time and being really, like, no... just barely, you know, paying rent and (C: M-hm.) food and so forth and so on. But, I do know how to do that and that may be what I decide to do.
C 9: It’s one possible option at any rate. Mhm.
S 10: But it seems like a real limited lifestyle.
C 10: It is clear to me from the, from the tears that came up the first that, that, uh, this is something you feel a lot of concern about, isn’t it?
S 11: Oh, I feel I’m two things . All alone and somewhat doomed to fail. 
C 11: Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.
S 12: And, uh, (clears throat) doomed to fail, not that I will die or (C: Mhm.) anything. I think doomed to fail and to be there for my children (C: Mhm. Mhm.) in a positive, cheerful, (C: Mhm.) warm, loving way. (C: Mhm. Mhm.) And being a single parent, like I will be (C: Mhm.) their support system to a large extent. (C: Mhm.) And it scares me to think of their main support as being exhausted (C: Mhm.) and irritated (C: Mhm.) and (C: Mhm.) ... (3 seconds pause.)
C 13: You just feel, “I may not be able to make it. I may be doomed (Sylvia smiles and nods.) to failure by the very circumstances.”
S 14: Right. (Nods.) (C: Mhm.) (10 second pause.) And talking about it this way I feel two ways: Like, “Oh c’mon Sylvia. Everybody else is doing it too.” And on the other hand, like, you’re willing to sit here and talk (laughs) about it with me (C: Mhm.) and I appreciate that. (Voice breaks.)
C 14: Mhm. Mhm. But you don’t have to just tell yourself, “Oh, buck up, you can do it.” It’s, it gives you a good chance to really...
S 15: (Takes Kleenex and wipes eyes.) Right. Well, I do do that, “Buck up, you can do it.” I’ll do that plenty. But I don’t get much opportunity to, (C: Nods.) to be sad with somebody about it. (C: Yeah.) How hard it (C: Yeah.) seems. (Crying.)
C 15: Yeah. Yeah. That’s the thing isn’t it? That to be all alone, with no support from anybody, it sounds like...
S 16: Well, I mean (C: I mean...) there are people that (C: Yeah, I know but...) care about me. (C: But...) There’s, like, no financial (C: Yeah.) support. (C: Mhm.) And it’s not like I’ll have my mother next door, (C: Mhm.) or something like that.
C 16: You’ll be alone with a heavy burden and it is a sad prospect really.
S 17: (Nods head.) (Pause 3 seconds.) It feels sad. (C: Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.) And I get... when I, (pauses) I depress myself by thinking, “Well, oh, sure I can give up my children.” And I think, “Well, I won’t do that.” Um, I’m seeing it as a black or white thing (C: Mhm.) and I know that’s not reality.
C 17: (Nods.) But it feels like reality. That either you’d have to give up your children or, or else (S: Mhm.) make a go of it.
S 18: But then I also feel suspicious of myself. Like, “Well, Sylvia, you’re used to so much of getting your needs met.” Like, going out at night sometimes, (C: Mhm.) um, having friends, (C: Mhm.) and, and having a social life and not being overtired. (C: Mhm.) And then I see myself as pampered. (C: Nods and smiles.) And, uh, if I just wasn’t so pampered, (laughs) things would be a lot better.
C 18: That’s when you kind of scold yourself, (: Uh-huh.) really. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. (pause 7 seconds) So that you really feel you’re gonna be hemmed in by that. I mean, your life is gonna be constricted (S: Mhm.) a good deal. A lot of the things you’ve been used to you just won’t have.
S 19: And want for myself.
C 19: And want for yourself. (S: Nods.) Uh-huh.
S 20: Yeah, that’s right.
C 20: So really it does look like a very tough period, doesn’t it?
S 21: Yep. It does. (pause 13 seconds) But, I like being able to be sad and complain about how terrible I’m afraid it’s going to be then I can... like now I’m feeling like, and I’m excited too, you know, about facing it.
C 21: Sort of a new phase of your life? Is it... it has excitement as well as dread in it, I guess.
S 21: (Nods.) Yeah about seeing what it will be like, (C: Mhm.) in fact. (C: Mhm.) (Sighs). 
C 21: It will be a new adventure but it’s one that, uh, you feel different ways about.
S 22: Mhm. Yeah. So that’s, that’s what I think about the most, in terms of a problem area. (C: Mhm. Mhm.) Like, the (smiles) way I started crying it seemed like I just couldn’t wait to get here and cry about it. (C: Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.) It was a little dramatic that way.
C 22: ‘Cos it is...well, it is, it is a real sad prospect. And one, I guess, that you don’t let out too much to other people, the sad side of it.
S 23: Right, I don’t do that (C: Nods.) very well. I, (C: Mhm.) I am busy being strong (C: Mhm.) unconsciously. Or I’m also busy being depressed. (C: Mhm.) (Sylvia smiles) I’ve learned well. I believe being sad and scared are more dealing with (C: Mhm. Mmm.) the problem.
C 23: Mhm. Yeah being, being frightened of what you’re taking on and sad of what you’re losing for yourself. (S: Nods.) Those are two very real (S: Hmm.) feelings.
S 24: And I, (pauses) I also think that part of my fear and excitement is that I’ll be doing something different. Like, I’ve never worked (C: Nods.) in, in my profession (C: Mhm. Mhm.) and been like a confident, (C: Mhm.) single woman with young children (C: Mhm.) who are doing well. (C: Mhm.) And it’s like, um, that’s what I want for myself. (C: Mhm.) (Sylvia laughs.)
C 24: It’s a goal you’ve been working toward. (S: Nods.) Mhm. (3 seconds pause.) I wonder sort of how do your children feel about this?
S 25: Well, my youngest son wants me to go work (C: Nods.) so that we can have more (C: Mhm.) money and so that he can have more spending money. And, uh, my oldest son has not, at this time, agreed to live with me yet. (C: Mmm.) But I’m preparing (C: Mhm.) with the hopes that he will at that time. (C: Mhm.) He is living with... he will be living with me the rest of the summer.
C 25: Mhm. So that’s another new part of the...
S 26: And my oldest son and I have a very strained relationship. He hasn’t been living with me the last two years. And so that’s gonna be another difficult part of what I’m talking about (C: Mhm.) is, um, at the same time needing and wanting to improve my relationship with Senate (C: Mhm.) and hoping there’ll be money for counseling. I’m hoping (C: Mhm.) that we can do work with a third party or in (C: Mhm.) a, uh, family group of some sort (C: Mhm.) because I believe that we’ll need help. (C: Mhm.) And, uh, so that’s, that, that part of the fall or the coming year scares me too about feeling so alienated from Senate.
C 26: “Will he, will he really accept me as a mother?”
S 27: (Phone rings) As his mother, (C: Yeah.) as someone who loves him (C: Mhm.) and cares about him.
C 27: So that’s a concern to ya, too.
S 28: (Nods.) (3 seconds pause.) Mhm. And can we get along? Can we live together? We haven’t lived together, and he’s lived in a very different lifestyle.
C 28: “Can we really form a relationship of the kind that both of us would like?”
S 29: Pardon?
C 29: Your asking yourself, “Can we really form a relationship that both of us will like?”
S 30: (Nods.) Mhm. Yeah, and be happy and, (C: Mhm.) yeah... (8 seconds pause.) (Smiles.) That’s an important... I hadn’t thought of that on my own, but you mentioning my children (C: Mhm.) brings up the part about Senate, which is a very important part of what I think about. (C: Mhm.) And I’m happy I’ll have him with us (C: Nods.) during the summer and we’ll be able to have time.
C 30: You can get a start on that. Mhm.
S 31: Mhm. Yeah. (C: Mhm.) When I’m not working, (smiles and nods) for example. (Pause 24 seconds.) Well, I felt awfully rigid about this upcoming filming. (C: Nods.) I felt it in my body a lot. And I feel, I felt more relaxed since we started.
C 31: Mhm. Mhm. (Pause 4 seconds.) It’s a really difficult thing.
S 32: Mhm. (Pauses.) Right, and just the same it’s exciting (C: Mhm.) to come (C: Mhm.) on this trip and to see you again (C: Mhm.) and it’s also frightening a lot. (C: Mhm.) Ya know, who’s gonna see it? And what are they gonna think? (C: Mhm.) And what’s it gonna look like? (C: Mhm.) Am I, am I being hard on myself or am I being good to myself? I don’t know - to put myself in this position (C: Yeah.) is what I mean.
C 32: Yeah. (Pause.) You have quite a little of conflict about, “Should I really be doing this? Who, who will see it? (S: Nods.) What will they say? Am I wise?”
S 33: Uh-huh. What’s it gonna be? What’s the finished project, gonna be? (C: Mhm.) (Clears throat.) Will I ever see it? (C: Mhm.) (Both smile.) (10 second pause.) 
C 33: (Pause 10 seconds.) Looks to me as though your eyes are saying something, but I don’t know what. (Smiles and laughs.)
S 34: Well, I’m thinking about how moved I’ve been when I’ve heard your voice a few times over the past year. (C: Hmm.) And now I’m here.
C 34: That made a...
S 35: I wanna take it in – (C: Mhm.) being here.
C 35: Mhm. (Pause 3 seconds.) I guess you’re saying that I mean a good deal to you.
S 36: Well, this time with you. (Nods.) Yes, you, mhm. (Smiles) (Pause 12 seconds) I’m thinking about what I want to talk about or I’m feeling kind of empty right now about talking. (Pause 5 seconds.)
C 36: Can you tell me what I do mean to you?
S 37: (Smiles.) Yes, I can. (Pause 8 seconds.) Well, (Pause 4 seconds) I think the best thing that I like to think about you is that as I understand your writings, I have not read very much that you’ve written, but that you have, that you live what you write about. And my understanding of a lot of popular writers are they write one thing and somehow they just don’t quite live that. They live something very different. And so I think of you as, (laughs) um, (pauses) wonderful in that way and not, uh... (Pause 3 seconds.)
C 37: But what does that mean to you?
S 38: (Sighs.) (Pause 3 seconds.) Well that it’s what I would like to be more: (C: Mhm. Mhm.) to have values and be able to, to do them (pauses) and to live them.
C 38: (Pause 4 seconds.) You’d like to have a good match between your life (S: Mhm.) and what you believe (S: Mhm. Mhm.) and value.
S 39: (Pause 3 seconds.) And what I also sense about you is, uh, like “patience” isn’t the right word, but I see you as being comfortable with yourself so much so that whatever I or anyone else says or does, doesn’t (pause 3 seconds) get you uptight.
C 39: (Laughs.)
S 40: (Laughing.) And maybe it does. (C: Mhm.) Sometimes it probably does ‘cause you’re a human being.
C 40: It certainly does, that’s right.
S 41: But it doesn’t seem like it does (C: Mhm. Mhm.) too much.
S 42: And I like that. I would like to be more present (C: Nods.) and, and comfortable with myself so that other people, including my children and so forth and so on, could do what they do, and that I could be able to be a source of support and not be personally threatened (C: Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.) by this little thing and that little thing.
C 42: And that, that has meaning to me. You’d like to be sufficiently accepting of yourself, that then you can be comfortable with what your children do or what other people do (S: Nods.) and not, uh, (S: Mhm.) not feel frightened, (S: Hmm.) thrown off balance.
S 43: (Nods.) Mhm. And I’ve enjoyed through the year in the few letters that I’ve gotten from you, your warmth, and interest in me, in my life. I’ve liked that a lot from (C: Mhm.) you. And at the time those letters were written we had no plans to (C: No.) make a movie (C: No.) or all that stuff so that was really enjoyable. (Pause 5 seconds.) Do you feel answered well?
C 43: Yeah. Mhm. Mhm. (Pause 15 seconds.) And I’m interested enough in you to know of any other things in your life that are important to you or that, uh, that are difficult for ya, or whatever.
S 44: (Pause 15 seconds.) Well, I’d like to go one of two ways. I don’t know which yet. Uh, one way would be back to the single working mother business. I’m not sure where we might go with that, but I know it’s a big thing for me. And another way would be to go with the difficulty I see myself in having with my relationships with men. (C: Mhm. Mmm.) (Pause 3 seconds.) I do so much analyzing (smiles) that I, I feel like throwing up my hands. “What’s the use of even talking about it?” But I...
C 44: But you do have (S: I...) difficulties in...
S 45: Yeah. I’ll, I’ll go with the men. (C: Okay.) And that’s the most frightening thing for me to talk about (C: Mhm.) on this film because people that I know will probably be seeing this (C: Mhm.) and men that I know. (4 second pause.) I see myself, uh, and this, this is real scattered in my mind. (Sighs.) Scattered, (smiles) and looking every which way. (C: Mhm.) Well, I see myself making acquaintance with men, many men, I mean not just one man (C: Mhm.) and spending some time with that person. And then, um, feeling that they lost interest in me or that I turned them off. And I tell myself things like, “You can’t expect every man you meet to fall in love with you.” (C: Mhm.) And, um, let’s see, (smiles) what else? (C: But you feel that you...) Oh and then I’ll tell myself all these reasonable... “Of course this man doesn’t like me because I’m this and I’m that and....” But, I don’t very often feel the disappointment and confusion about “Well I had a good time with that man.” And it seems to me like he must not have had a good time with me because I didn’t hear from him again, or I did and things went such and such a way. And, uh...
C 45: Sounds like it seems kind of mysterious to you. (S: Uh-huh.) Why the men lose interest in you.
S 46: Uh-huh. And then I have feedback from one person, one man friend of mine, who says that I create, ya know I turn people off, men, myself. And so it’s like it’s all, it’s all my doing anyway. (C: Mhm.) But I have felt lately impotent about how to, (Pause 7 seconds.) how to have a successful long rel- long lasting relationship with a man. Successful, I don’t mean perfect, I mean (C: Yeah. Mhm.) workable. (C: Mhm.) And, uh, I think workable is successful (C: Mhm.) these days. (Smiles.) Yeah.
C 46: Well, that’s a part of your life in which you just haven’t had the kind of, um, success that you wish you had had. Mhm. Mhm. An important lack in some way.
S 47: (Nods.) Now I’m remembering we talked about this before.
C 47: A little bit.
S 48: A little bit, right. (Sighs.) (Pause 7 seconds.) And I do that, the kind of analyzing that ‘”Well I have all these habits like, uh, I, um, I like to be by myself, I’m not real generous and outgoing (C: Nods.) and taking care of, of people that I meet.” And the woman that I live with says that she doesn’t see me doing that at all like, “Oh come in I’ll fix you dinner, I’ll do this, I’ll do that.” Like I don’t do that. (C: Nods) And, and so I’m confused about do I need to do that to be in a close relationship? It doesn’t seem to me like I should (C: Mhm.) need to sell out to be um enjoyed and wanted.
C 48: I gather what you mean by “selling out” is that if you, if you really put yourself out in kind of an artificial way, you don’t want that. Is that what you’re saying? 
S 49: Yes, if I do all these things for a man, so then he’ll want me.
C 49: Mhm. Kind of buying his favor, (S: Nods. Mhm.) as it were. And you just don’t see yourself doing that. Don’t wanna do that.
S 50: Or wanting to do it. (C: Mhm. Mhm.) (S: Nods.) And then I... another question, hard question, I ask myself is, “Well, I’m choosing men to relate to that don’t know how to give in the way that I want to be given to.” (C: Mhm. Mhm.) And then I try (smiles) to figure that one out. (C: Mhm.) “Oh simple, I’m choosing, that just means I need to choose differently.” (C: Mhm.) And then I look around and it doesn’t seem so simple.
C 50: Mhm. You say you’re trying to analyze and analyze and analyze what, “what lack in me?” or “you know what lack in me?’ I guess your asking yourself mostly, “What lack in me keeps, (S: Hmm.) keeps me from having a lasting (S: Mhm.) relationship with men?”
S 51: And one thing that now I’m recalling that really frightened me was I was talking- I lived with my husband for eight years (C: Nods.) and I felt rejected by him and I left him. (C: Nods.) And I left him for a man I was very much in love with that I’ve been very close to (C: Mhm.) for five years. But he’s also... like, I moved away from him but I felt left (smiles) by him also. And so this man friend of mine said to me, “Well, what’s wrong with you that you can’t keep a man?” And that, uh, that really scared me inside because when I look at the situation in a practical, sensible way that doesn’t seem like reality. (C: Mhm.) But then I don’t know maybe it’s true.
C 51: But that her saying that (S: He.) he saying that, (S: Uh-huh.) uh, really does touch something in you. “Is there something wrong with me (S: Uh-huh.) that I....“
S 52: That I don’t see. (C: Mhm.) And, and, uh, just the fact that it touched me so much shows me that there’s something there.
C 52: Mhm. It, (S: Sighs.) it wouldn’t bother you that much, or you wouldn’t think so much about it if there wasn’t something in you that that refers to.
S 53: Mhm. (Nods.) And I, (sighs) I see my mother that way a lot, that my mother not being able to have a successful relationship with a man and so that’s been my model and... (Pause 3 seconds) like, why can’t...
C 53: You’re saying, “Maybe, maybe I’m just following the same pattern as my mother.”
S 54: Mhm. Well, I am in that respect and I don’t like it. (C: Mhm.) And I’m not willing to do a bunch of crummy stuff that I... (C: Mhm.) (Pause 6 seconds.) So, right now (smiles) I’m living alone (C: Mhm.) and I’m not doing any crummy stuff. (C: Mhm.) And I also have some very nice relationships. It’s (smiles) those shades of black and white. (Pause 8 seconds.) But I do feel a lot of confusion about building an intimate relationship. (C: Mhm.) A monogamous type (C: Mhm. Mhm.) or primary...
C 54: So you can have good times and all that, but still there is this nagging question or these nagging questions, “Am I just following my mother’s pattern?” “What is wrong with me that I don’t have a permanent relationship with a man?”
